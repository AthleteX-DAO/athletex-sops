One of AthleteX's core customers are athletes

Here are the variations of athletes who have expressed interest in AthleteX:

  An owner of an athlete training facility from the dominican republic focused on baseball athletes.  
  
  Amateur UFC athletes fighting in a battle royale 


  All of these athletes had the exact same problem:  they were under-financed and needed a platform for them to make money.
  The also had a community or audience of people behind them willing to finanically support them, in an entertaining way.

  Hector tried to solve this problem with NFTs, while the UFC athletes solved this problem through selling merch.
