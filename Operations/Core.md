AthleteX has a very specific core component to our business:

Network Effects and User Experience.

AthleteX Markets strives to make it extremely easy and intuitive to use our platform, to the point where you do not need any explanation on how to get started.

Leveraging our excellent user experience, we aim to achieve so much critical mass that it does not make sense for our users to use traditional platforms.  By leveraging our product lines of: 
event performance markets,
cross-sport fantasy sports,
seasonal performance markets,
and perpetual prerformance markets,
 we aim to be a one stop shop for the sports finance enthusiast.
