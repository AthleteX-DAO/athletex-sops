AthleteX has two separate products with different offerings

AthleteX Exchange is the dapp interface for interacting with the protocol smart contracts & cryptocurrencies.  It has these key features:


AthleteX Predictions (live) --> which focuses on daily event markets

AthleteX Seasonal --> Seasonal Markets

AthleteX Swap --> exchanging APTs

AthleteX Farms --> Seeding liquidity for APTs

AthleteX LaunchPad (unreleased) --> which focuses on capitalizing and launching new APT tokens to the exchange



AthleteX Markets are the financial primitives (the Athlete Performance Tokens) made by AthleteX protocol (event APTs, seasonal APTs, perpetual APTs)

Event APTs are singular prediction markets based on an outcome.

Seasonal APTs are forward contract (American style) options that expire when an athlete's season ends.

Perpetual APTs are career oriented markets based on the BitMEX perpetual contracts.  (This works exactly like the industry standard)
