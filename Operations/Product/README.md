AthleteX can be broken up into three distinct software components that maintain operations and fill orders

-----------------------------------------------------

AthleteX Markets is the brokerage that lists markets

  AthleteX Predictions (live) --> which focuses on daily event markets

  AthleteX Seasonal --> Seasonal Markets

  AthleteX Swap --> exchanging APTs

  AthleteX Farms --> Seeding liquidity for APTs

  AthleteX LaunchPad (unreleased) --> which focuses on capitalizing and launching new APT tokens to the exchange


AthleteX Router is the API that combines, routes and places orders for existing Sports, DeFi & TradFi orderflows.


AthleteX Protocol is the financial primitives (the Athlete Performance Tokens & Markets) traded on the decentralized exchange

  Event APTs are singular prediction markets based on an outcome.

  Seasonal APTs are forward contract (American style) options that expire when an athlete's season ends.

  Perpetual APTs are career oriented markets based on the BitMEX perpetual contracts.  (This works exactly like the industry standard)
