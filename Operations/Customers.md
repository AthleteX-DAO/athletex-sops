So far, we've identified 5 different types of AthleteX personas:

> Frat college student who watches sports

> College professor of finance with an understanding of options markets and follow sports

> Under financed athletes who are looking to grow their professional careers

> Cryptocurrency traders on Twitter like Gainzy

> Fantasy sports fans who like to watch multiple sports 



We currently have, and plan to introduce these product offerings for these consumers:

> Binary event markets for the frat college student to enjoy with his friends

> Seasonal and Career markets for hedging and speculating on an athlete's price

> An athlete launchpad program where athletes can offer their Name, Image, and Likeness for NFTs

> Crypto Perpetual Athlete Markets (with options for Leverage Trading) for them to trade new assets on technology they are familiar with

> We offer a cross-sport fantasy league option for them to engage with all of them at once.
