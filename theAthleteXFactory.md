The AthleteX Customer Factory is the system that turns sports fans into happy athletex users.

This is a detailed factory blueprint of the types of customers we are targetting, and how the factory will look for each type of customer.

The customer factory will go through four evolutions AthleteX 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0.
So far, we have successfully completed AthleteX 1.0.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

AthleteX Factory 1.0:  This iteration was focused on establishing the foundations of the structure (i.e. building the factory)

0 - Customer - Sports focused Crypto users (ex. Andrew-SX Jake-SX, existentialKevin, Pearlson)

question: what is the TAM of this factory?  idk but it is too small.  We only got a couple hundred customers throughout 2022, and that is not sustainable.

1 - Acquisition - DeFi Slate, Twitter

2 - Activation - AthleteX promo video

3 - Retention - about 6 months

4 - Revenue - ~$200k

5 - Referral - Clyde, LunaFi, CoachCryptos

This has some room to grow, but this outlines the core as I've seen it.
