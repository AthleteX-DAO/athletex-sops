An example of a successful sale process was with SX Network:

1 - We will build synthetix athlete performance tokens

2 - We need stuff for people to do on SX network

3 - A options market for crypto sports bettors

4 - We build the thing for them


And to Scale this case study to other exchanges, it'll go something like this:

1) AthleteX specializes in producing athlete performance markets / SportsFi markets
2) you have xyz customers that need more cool stuff to do OR you have xyz orders that need to be offset from your books.
3) We have built solutions for these problems in the form of an API which you can pay us $50,000/mo to use (saves you $$)
