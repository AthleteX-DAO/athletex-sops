AthleteX solves for exactly one mass market demand, but with modern technology.


Since forever, there have been multiple iterations of 'athelete stock markets' in the UK & USA.  They have all failed for the exact same reason FTX failed.

Business owners intermingle funds between customer deposits and business needs, a bankrun occurs because of unforseen conditions, and the business implodes.

Back to the point:  AthleteX is built to be a crypto athlete stock market.

What the mass markets want is the ability to hold and trade stock/crypto/whatever of their favorite athlete.

There is a strong emotional attachment that a person feels to their favorite athlete / sports team.  What people want, is the ability to hold, trade and feel attached to their team.

That is AthleteX's ONE thing it can do better than PredictionStrike, SportX, Polymarkets and others.
