Liquidity - Management


I highly encourage a 5:1 books to market ratio of capital for liquidity management.  What this means is for every $20,000 in the market, we should keep ~$80,000 on the books.

What happens if you don't do this:
Vampire traders looking to suck liquidity out will always exist, and there may be stress case scenarios where liquidity runs dangerously low.

Most likely vampires are stealing liqudity through selling, so in the case of an individual or small group of people doing the selling, we can out bid them
by flooding the market to absorb their sell pressure.


Also, having reserves is just very important.
