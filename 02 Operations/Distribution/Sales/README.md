Some of these sales letters are very crude, but they work and can flow much more smoothly with refinements

Another example of a successful sale process was with SX Network: 

1 - We will build synthetix athlete performance tokens

2 - We need stuff for people to do on SX network

3 - A options market for crypto sports bettors 

4 - We build the thing for them
