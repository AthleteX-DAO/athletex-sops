The AthleteX 2023 Retrospective:

In 2023, it was a bit slow in the first half.  Within the industry, prices collapsed (BTC < 30K), and demand dried up.  It was absolutely a crypto 'winter'.  In the second half of the year, Q3, Q4, the market slowly recovered, but with no new entrants into the market.  A lot of projects opened their doors again.

A few observations:

90% of the crypto market is made of of builders and highly sophisticated software engineers.  The vast majority of crypto projects we have access to are looking for marketing to acquire new customers.

The crypto native consumer audience already has many choices for speculating on sports, the biggest one being sx.bet.  It's extremely expensive to acquire a crypto-native consumer, about $500 CAC.  yikes.

The two biggest competitors to AthleteX within the crypto markets are SX.bet & Overtime Markets, which we have relationships with through The Rollup.  These projects have a majority of market share, which is still extremely small;  In 6 years, SX has earned ~ 5,000 users, which is smaller than the town of Boone NC.

Outside of the crypto native audience, there is exceptionally strong demand for this product.  People have consistently hit me up looking to be involved.  

LinkedIn Audience:
    The LinkedIn business audience is open to this product, and I have seen demand from international venture capitalists and hedge fund managers.

    When I got on calls with business people & described the athletex project to them, vast majority of them spoke in a way that seemed like AthleteX was a guaranteed success and money printer.

    Within the sports betting / athlete stock market, none of our peers have our technology advantage.  Personally, after FTX I am extremely suspicious & curious to see how our competitors capitalize their markets.
