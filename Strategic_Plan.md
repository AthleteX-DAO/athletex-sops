-----Drivers----------------------------------------------

*Market Leadership* 

Leadership in the sports prediction market industry (already leading in crypto prediction market!)

*Operational / Tech Focus*
Decentralized, asynchronous development combined with disciplined innovation


*Contributors & Organization*

Effective, forward moving and results oriented coalition-led governance


*Financial Performance*

Deep token liquidity, Profit-fueled growth --  need to add more to this.  When AX was set at 10c, it collapsed because there was no demand side to support token valuation.  Paul W. Bradley also suggested fundraising to set token price but i think this only works to limited extent ( see FTX, LUNA crashes, the centralized players fundraised but no amount of fundraising can beat 'the market' )
