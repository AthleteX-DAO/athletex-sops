AthleteX Strategic Plan

Our Mission
-------------

AthleteX's mission is to become a free, public decentralized market for the trading of athlete performance.
// free is not capital efficient, i think we mean free in terms of freedom such as openly accessible / censorship resistance
Based on our recent conversations with Paul, Christian, and each other we can refine the above mission statement into the following:
AthleteX's mission is to become a public cornerstone for athlete monetization - an NIL marketplace, fantasy sports platform, and trading card studio for athletes, fans, and brands.


2023 Breakthrough Goals
-------------

Greater than $10m in quarterly trading volume by Q3 2023
