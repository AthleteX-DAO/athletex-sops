Hello Community:

Last Month the main focus was our planning period, and we spent a good amount of time making detailed plans of what this year must happen this year for us to exist, and ultimately succeed in the immediate future.  Our plans for the first Q1 of 2023 are focusing on generating real traction, and living ourselves out of the existing rut we're in.  We have plans for the long term future, and must remain focused on the immediate term future to realize those things.
