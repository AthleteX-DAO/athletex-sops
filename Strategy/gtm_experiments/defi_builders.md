--> They really, really really enjoy watching charts go way up & then melt unexpectedly


Urgent Problems:

--> Like sports & money, but don't want to gamble

--> They have traction, but very little and need to get in front of more people

--> they don't like inefficiences (see it as a money making opportunity)

--> Elite, and in a community of the best in the world, but don't have a way to show that

--> Likes meme coins & wants more

--> Isolated on the internet & need to connect with other like-minded groups & communities
