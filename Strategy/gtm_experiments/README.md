A simple framework for designing go to market experiments using AthleteX DAO capital.


AthleteX GTM Framework:  How to think through a n experiment

Customer Profile: 
The customer profile is a single person representing a nich of people with a specific problem, or who are in specific circumstances

Urgent Problem:
This is a painpoint the customer is suffering from.  It could be psychological, technical, or even temporary.  But the important part is the pain is so urgent they are willing to pay a certain amount of money to have it solved.

Our Solution:
    This is the desired end state AthleteX DAO's resources provide the customer profile. The end state has less to do with specific technology, than it does giving the customer a feeling: relief to their problem.

    Mechanism: This is the 'how' we deliver the desired end state.  Athlete Performance Tokens, yea?

    Pricing: This is the price the customer is willing to pay for which is a function of how much they can afford

Access Channel:
    This is how we reach end users and customers.  The access channel can vary between end users & customers, and will vary depending on the customer profile's habits & technology channels.
